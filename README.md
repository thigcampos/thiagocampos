# Iukeri
Iukeri represents the culmination of three years of continuous redesign. Every minor change in my life prompted a new iteration of the site's design,turning it into a never-ending in-development project.  
### Design
In early 2023, I began conceptualizing the core structure of Iukeri, drawing inspiration heavily from the websites of [Yaroslav Samoylov](tab:https://yaosamo.com) and [Danilo Tanic](tab:https://danilotanic.com). Over the following months, the design underwent numerous subtle updates, each influenced by a variety of sources. These sources ranged from my [Bossa & Café](tab:https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6unyax6qQyhunvOd2QOAzB?si=0b069d34368f4773) Spotify playlist to episodes of [London Diaries](tab:https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3F8c49z5qlQkQOwZLYN_4Q03cEneiOlG&si=yAoGu0mkeaz-soJh) by Daniel Simmons, as well as handpicked [Vintage Ads](tab:https://www.pinterest.fr/thigcampos/iukeri/) discovered on Pinterest. Additional changes were made during the website's development, with more likely to come in the months and years ahead.
### Development
As for the development of the website, the technical scope involves using [NextJS](tab:https://nextjs.org) with TypeScript. For the back-end, a straightforward blog system developed using FastAPI, named [Papyrus](tab:https://github.com/ivansantiagojr/papyrus). After outlining the initial application infrastructure, I made the decision to start with a front-end-only application as the initial phase of the MVP. To replace Papyrus in the MVP, I tried using [mdx-remote](tab:https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote), but I had some problems. After doing some research, I did the initial setup of [ContanteLayer](tab:https://contentlayer.dev/) and it worked like a charm.
### Deployment
The deployment of the MVP version of Iukeri was carried out on Cloudflare Pages. It was a straightforward process, as Cloudflare offers a guide for deploying various types of applications, including [NextJS Apps](tab:https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/deploy-a-nextjs-site)
